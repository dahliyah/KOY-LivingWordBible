- Welcome to our collaborative Bible study notes project! This repository is dedicated to hosting Obsidian notes and files creating a shared space for individuals to contribute and share their insights, thoughts, and study notes on the Bible. Whether you are a scholar, student, or simply passionate about the Bible, we invite you to join us in creating a comprehensive resource for Bible study.

### Description from Docs
```
- This is a Living Bible in the sense that its commentary, context inserts, notes, photos, links, and even the translation itself is made by this community
- Make Notes while reading as you would in your own paper Bible, but all can learn and question your input.
- Make Comments on words or sentences and have others reply to your comments to resolve or input your insight.
- Suggest edits, typos, notes, cross-references, photos, charts, maps, etc.
- Comments on history, definitions, etymology, and interpretations are welcome, regardless of doctrinal bias or knowledge.
```
