# Jubilees 1


## Date

It came to pass in the 1st year of the Exodus of the children of Israel out of Egypt, on the 16th day of the 3rd month, [2450 Anno Mundi] that Elohim spoke to Moses, saying:¬†

‚û§ **<mark style='background:#F3CF00'>[Messenger of the Presence]</mark>**:¬†
- Come up to Me on the **Mountain**, and I will give you <mark style='background:#AAE2A9'>2 tables of stone</mark> of the <mark style='background:#f5ff00'>Law</mark> and of the **commandment**, which I have written, that you may teach them.
    

  

**Moses** went up into the <u>**Mountain** of **Elohim**</u>, and the glory of **Yahuah** abode on **Mt. Sinai**, and a cloud overshadowed it **6 days**. **Yahuah** called to **Moses** on the **7th day** out of the midst of the cloud, and the appearance of the glory of <mark style='background:#AAE2A9'>Yahuah was like a flaming fire on the top of the Mountain</mark>.

**Moses** was on the **Mountain** for <u>**40 days** and **40 nights**</u>, and Elohim taught him the earlier and the later history of the division of all the days of the law and of the testimony.

‚û§ [**<mark style='background:#F3CF00'>Messenger of the Presence</mark>**]:¬†
- Incline your heart to every word which I will speak to you on this Mountain, and write them in a book in order that their generations may see how I have not forsaken them for all the evil which they have made in transgressing the covenant which I establish between Me and you for their generations this day on **Mt. Sinai**. It will come to pass when all these things come upon them, that they will recognise that I am more righteous than they in all their judgments and in all their actions, and they will recognise that I have been truly with them. Do write for yourself all these words which I declare to you this day, for I know their rebellion and their stiff neck, before I bring them into the land of which I swore to their fathers, to **Abraham**, **Isaac**, and **Jacob**, saying:¬†
    

'To your seed will I give a land flowing with **milk** and **honey**. And they will eat and be satisfied, and they will turn to strange gods, to gods which cannot deliver them from any of their tribulation: and this witness will be heard for a witness against them. For they will forget all My **commandments**, even all that I command them, and they will walk after the Gentiles, and after their uncleanness, and after their shame, and will serve their gods, and these will prove to them an offense and a tribulation and an affliction and a snare. And many will perish and they will be taken captive, and will fall into the hands of the enemy, because they have forsaken My **ordinances** and My **commandments**, and the **Festivals** of My **covenant**, and My **Sabbaths**, and My holy place which I have set-apart for Myself in their midst, and My **tabernacle**, and My **sanctuary**, which I have set-apart for Myself in the midst of the land, that I should set my name upon it, and that it should live there. And they will make to themselves <u>high places</u> and <u>groves</u> and <u>graven images</u> [idols], and they will worship, each his own <u>graven image</u> [image or idol made to worship], so as to go astray, and they will sacrifice their children to **<span style='color:#FF0000'>Demons</span>**, and to all the works of the error of their hearts. I will send witnesses to them, that I may witness against them, but they will not hear,**

- and will slay the witnesses also, and they will persecute those who seek the law, and they will abolish and change everything so as to work evil before My eyes. I will hide My face from them, and I will deliver them into the hand of the **Gentiles** for captivity, and for a prey, and for devouring, and I will remove them from the midst of the land, and I will scatter them amongst the **Gentiles**. And they will forget all My **Law** and all My **commandments** and all My judgments, and will go astray as to New Months, and Sabbaths, and Festivals, and Jubilees, and ordinances. And after this they will turn to Me from amongst the Gentiles with all their heart and with all their soul and with all their strength, and I will gather them from amongst all the Gentiles, and they will seek me, so that I will be found of them, when they seek me with all their heart and with all their soul. I will disclose to them abounding peace with righteousness, and I will remove them the plant of uprightness, with all My heart and with all My soul, and they will be for a blessing and not for a curse, and they will be the head and not the tail. I will build My sanctuary in their midst, and I will live with them, and I will be their Elohim and they will be My people in truth and righteousness. I will not forsake them nor fail them; for I am Yahuah their Elohim.from the beginning to here is about telling moses about how people are going t be?
    

Moses fell on his face and prayed and said
